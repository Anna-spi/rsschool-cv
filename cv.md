## About me

For my life I a few times encountered programming. But it wasn’t the same. I wasn't ready dive into this sphere fully. I haven’t seen her conspicuously. After the period and the events of my life, I suddenly realized that’s exactly what I want to do. That I’m willing to spend all my time, in what I want to realize myself in.

My goal is to become a required Front-end developer. I was fascinated by this profession, the whole IT sphere with its constant development. There are very smart people here. Every one of whom has a full personality, with his or her knowledge and skills.

Every day to grow and develop in his profession and meet interesting people and become involved in exciting projects?
